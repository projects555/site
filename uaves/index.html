        UAVES – Erotique Lyrics
        The way that you move
        It makes me feel crazy in love
        The things that we do
        Like Beyonce and Jay-z in love
        If you feel like ride, then ride it ride it
        You can if you feel , ride it ride it
        You know that I will love it ,love it
        I`ll make you fly like a rocket , rocket
        Into the sky
        I feel your stiletto
        Your lips saying let`s go
        I`m loosing my mind
        You`re so seductive and you know I want this
        You`re taking your time
        Girl you`re a tease
        Your looks makes me freeze
        You`re one of a kind
        Your skin is so smooth
        I feel I can`t touch it enough
        Girl you have no clue
        Of how this waiting is tough
        If you feel like ride, then ride it ride it
        You can if you feel , ride it ride it
        You know that I will love it ,love it
        I`ll make you fly like a rocket , rocket
        If you feel like ride, then ride it ride it
        You know that I will love it ,love it
        I`ll make you fly like a rocket , rocket
        Into the sky
        If you hide , I`ll find you
        I`ll come from behind you
        We`ll play hide and seek
        My arms around you
        You know what I`m up to
        There`s no time for sleep
        I`ll first take you slow
        Just to make you want more
        Treat you like a hoe
    </p>
